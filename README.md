# Computing Course Designs

A collection of my notes and code examples for computing courses I have designed.

## Introduction to Computer Science I (CS1)
This is the first course taken by computer science majors at Carleton University.  Although many students have programmed prior to taking this class, it is designed to work for complete beginners.

More information about the course design is available [here](http://gailcarmichael.com/teaching/coursedesign/cs1).

## Introduction to Computer Science II (CS2)
Most students take this course after Introduction to Computer Science I, but it is meant to be a self-contained course for anyone with a semester's worth of prior programming experience.  My design introduces C++ and Java in the same semester and aims to focus on problem solving rather than syntax.

Please note that code examples from [Think Like a Programmer](http://www.nostarch.com/thinklikeaprogrammer), one of our course textbooks, are not included here.
