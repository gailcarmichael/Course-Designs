## Introduction to Computer Science II (CS2)
Most students take this course after Introduction to Computer Science I, but it is meant to be a self-contained course for anyone with a semester's worth of prior programming experience.  My design introduces C++ and Java in the same semester and aims to focus on problem solving rather than syntax.

The central idea of my design is to begin the course with basic C++ and problem solving skills.  From there, we add problem solving with arrays, discussing how variables and arrays are stored in memory.  We introduce Java with a procedural style, allowing us to begin comparing some of the things that Java does automatically with C++'s more manual approach.  After covering object basics and dynamic memory, we slowly transition into studying Java only, covering more advanced object-oriented programming topics.  Our central textbooks are Think Like a Programmer and Introduction to Computer Science Using Java.

The objective of the course is to have students become proficient in Java, so they do not learn a lot of C++.  In fact, we use only a minimum of C++ to illustrate that while you make explicit choices in C++, such as whether to pass by value or by reference, these choices are made implicitly for you in Java.  In other words, learning C++ is in service of more deeply understanding Java.  Translation exercises emphasize differences between the languages, and students are only asked to write simple programs in C++ (more complex programs are written in Java).

Please note that code examples from [Think Like a Programmer](http://www.nostarch.com/thinklikeaprogrammer), one of our course textbooks, are not included here.  Instead, you will find lecture notes and custom code samples.
