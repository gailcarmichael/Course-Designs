## Go Code Girl Workshop with Processing

In 2013, I started Go Code Girl with Nathalie Valli√®res as a joint initiative between Carleton University and the University of Ottawa. [Go Code Girl](http://www.onwie.ca/programs/go-code-girl) has since become an Ontario-wide initiative, run by the [Ontario Network of Women in Engineering (ONWiE)](http://www.onwie.ca/).

Our first Go Code Girl event in 2013 taught high school girls Processing in a one-day workshop. Instruction went as follows, using the slides included here:

* Introduction to computer science
* Women in CS
* Memory game demo
* Brief intro to key programming concepts in the context of the memory game, along with small challenges and time to explore before moving on to the next concept:
    * variables
    * true, false, and if
    * loops
    * arrays and lists
    * methods
    * objects
* Opportunity to try detailed tutorials I wrote, explaining how to complete small Processing projects:
