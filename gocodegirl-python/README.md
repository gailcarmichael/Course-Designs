## Go Code Girl Workshop with Python

In 2013, I started Go Code Girl with Nathalie Valli√®res as a joint initiative between Carleton University and the University of Ottawa. [Go Code Girl](http://www.onwie.ca/programs/go-code-girl) has since become an Ontario-wide initiative, run by the [Ontario Network of Women in Engineering (ONWiE)](http://www.onwie.ca/).

In 2014 and 2015, we hosted Go Code Girl over two days (one at each university) and focused on Python.

On day 1, after getting a brief introduction to computer science, basic programming concepts were introduced in the context of the [Python Turtle module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html). For each concept, students tried an example and were given ways to explore further.

On day 2, students learned the basics of what the [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) is and how to operate it. They learned command line basics, and tried some guided tutorials (not included here).
