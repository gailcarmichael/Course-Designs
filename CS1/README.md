## Introduction to Computer Science I (CS1)
This is the first course taken by computer science majors at Carleton University.  Although many students have programmed prior to taking this class, it is designed to work for complete beginners.

When teaching the major and non-major section of this course, I use Processing.  My approach is inspired by previous offerings, but reorganized according to two principles: first, that it is better to introduce the minimum number of concepts at one time so students can become used to each one before complexity is increased; and second, that it is better to introduce concepts in the context of an interesting problem instead of as a sequential laundry list of things to know.   Processing is very well suited to these principles because it is possible to make interesting and even complex programs knowing only a few concepts.  For example, students can create Pong in their fourth week, knowing only variables, functions, and if statements.

Note that while major examples are included here, students are also shown numerous more minor examples to focus on a single concept.
