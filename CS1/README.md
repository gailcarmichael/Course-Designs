## Introduction to Computer Science I (CS1)

This course was first designed for students of COMP 1405, the first course taken by computer science majors at Carleton University.  Although many students have programmed prior to taking this class, it is designed to work for complete beginners.

I use [Processing](http://www.processing.org) for this course for two central reasons:
* Processing makes it easy to introduce the minimum number of concepts at one time so students can become used to each one before complexity is increased. For example, in less than ten lectures, students who know only variables, functions, and if-statements can create a working Pong game.
* Thanks to the visual nature of Processing, concepts can more easily be introduced in the context of interesting problems instead of as a sequential laundry list of things to know.

Only lecture slides and major programming examples are included here.
