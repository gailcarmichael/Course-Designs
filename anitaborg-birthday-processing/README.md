## Anita Borg Birthday Celebration

Members of the Anita Borg Alumnia Community (winners and finalists of the Google Anita Borg Memorial scholarship) organize events between January and February around the world to celebrate Anita Borg's birthday. The goal of the events is to encourage more women to enter computer science and software engineering.

For the 2016 event, I and a group of awesome women at Shopify put on an event targeting female students with a major outside of computer science. Our aim was to show them how learning even a bit of computer science or programming would benefit them. We had a talk, mentoring activity, and coding workshop.
